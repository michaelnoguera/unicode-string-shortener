# Unicode String Shortener

The idea of this project is to compress text in terms of bytes or characters used while maintaining its human readability.

Here is an example of intended program behavior:
```
Enter string to shorten: abcae
Input:                         abcae                (5)
Shortest in bytes:             abcæ                 (5)
Shortest in characters used:   abcæ                 (4)
```
